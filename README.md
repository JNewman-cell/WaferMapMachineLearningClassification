In this code I used machine learning to create a model that classified real wafer map data with >80% accuracy. I used feature extraction and creation so the Decision Tree classifier from SKLearn was able to distinguish the unique characteristics of each failure type. I used five categories of failure classification, Center, Edge-Loc, Donut, Near-Full, and Scratch.
